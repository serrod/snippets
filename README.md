Randon Code that Makes My Life Easier

Over the years, I have developed all sorts of code to sort, parse, automate, and so on. Unfortunately, I never kept a single point repo to track it or archive it, instead, it was left scattered all over the place. 
Soâ€¦ let try keeping it in GitHub. Who knows, it might be useful to someone else.
